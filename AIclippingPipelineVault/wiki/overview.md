# OpenClaw Stream Clipper

A self-contained, Docker-based system that automatically finds and extracts highlight moments from livestream VODs using locally-hosted AI models. Zero cloud API costs. Controlled through Discord or a web dashboard.

---

## What it does

1. User drops a `.mp4` or `.mkv` VOD into `vods/`
2. User sends a natural-language command to the Discord bot ("clip the lacy stream", "find the funny moments")
3. The system runs an 8-stage pipeline: transcribes audio, detects high-energy moments using keywords + LLM analysis, scores frames with a vision model, renders clips, and delivers them back to Discord

Output: 1080×1920 vertical MP4 clips (~45 seconds each) with burned-in subtitles and a blurred-fill background. Ready for TikTok, Reels, Shorts.

## Architecture: one container + native Windows LLM

| Component | Where | Role |
|---|---|---|
| [[entities/lm-studio]] | Windows host (native) | LLM inference server — serves Qwen models over OpenAI-compatible HTTP on port 1234 |
| Stream Clipper | Docker container (`stream-clipper`) | OpenClaw agent, Discord gateway, FFmpeg, faster-whisper, web dashboard |

The pipeline calls LM Studio at `http://host.docker.internal:1234` — Docker's bridge hostname that routes from the container back to the Windows host. The user manages LM Studio (model loading, GPU assignment) through LM Studio's own GUI; the pipeline never touches it except to call `/v1/chat/completions` and `/api/v1/models/unload`.

**Why LM Studio instead of Ollama-in-Docker**: LM Studio runs natively on Windows and supports NVIDIA+AMD multi-GPU without WSL2 Vulkan driver hacks. No Vulkan ICD injection issues. GPU assignment is handled through LM Studio's GUI. See [[entities/lm-studio]].

## AI models

| Model | LM Studio ID | Role | Hardware |
|---|---|---|---|
| [[entities/qwen35]] | `qwen/qwen3.5-35b-a3b` or `qwen/qwen3.5-9b` (or Gemma 4 `google/gemma-4-26b-a4b`) | **Unified multimodal model** — text detection (Stages 3–4) + vision enrichment (Stage 6). Setting text and vision to the same ID skips the Stage 5→6 VRAM swap. | GPU (LM Studio manages) |
| ~~[[entities/qwen3-vl]]~~ | *retired — pipeline now uses the multimodal model above* | — | — |
| [[entities/faster-whisper]] | `large-v3` | Speech-to-text transcription (Stages 2 and 7) | GPU via CUDA → CPU (int8) fallback |

Model IDs are set via `config/models.json` (managed through the dashboard Models panel). LM Studio handles GPU assignment. The pipeline unloads models between stages via `POST /api/v1/models/unload`. See [[concepts/vram-budget]] and [[entities/lm-studio]] for 9B vs 35B behavior differences.

> [!note] 35B vs 9B tradeoffs
> The 35B model (`qwen3.5-35b-a3b`) produces better moment detection but has permanently-enabled thinking mode in LM Studio (cannot be disabled). Pipeline is designed for this — generous `max_tokens` lets it finish reasoning + answer. 9B is much faster and works correctly with `chat_template_kwargs` suppressing thinking. Both are supported.

## The pipeline

```
Stage 1: Discovery            — find new/named VOD files
Stage 2: Transcription        — chunked GPU Whisper, cached
Stage 3: Segment Detection    — classify stream type, build profile
Stage 4: Moment Detection     — Pass A keywords + Pass B LLM + Pass C merge/select
Stage 4.5 Moment Groups       — (optional) narrative arcs + stitch bundles
Stage 5: Frame Extraction     — 6 JPEGs per candidate moment
Stage 6: Vision Enrichment    — score boosts, titles, hook, originality hints
Stage 6.5 Camera Pan Prep     — (optional) OpenCV face tracking → crop path
Stage 7: Editing & Export     — framing + originality + stitch render, batch captions
Stage 8: Logging              — processed.log, diagnostics JSON, Discord report
```

## Two interfaces

**Discord bot** (primary): Natural-language commands. Style and stream type inferred automatically. Results delivered as inline video attachments. See [[entities/discord-bot]].

**Web dashboard** (secondary): Flask app on port 5000. VOD library, clip controls, 8-stage progress monitor, live log streaming via SSE, clips gallery. Works on Windows host via `docker exec` bridge. See [[entities/dashboard]].

## Clip styles

| Command intent | Style | Prioritizes |
|---|---|---|
| Default / "clip my stream" | `auto` | Best moments, balanced variety |
| "funny", "comedy" | `funny` | Comedy, awkward moments, banter |
| "hype", "exciting" | `hype` | Clutch plays, high-energy |
| "emotional" | `emotional` | Heartfelt, vulnerable moments |
| "spicy takes", "hot take" | `hot_take` | Controversial opinions |
| "storytime", "story" | `storytime` | Narratives with payoff |
| "reactions", "rage" | `reactive` | Strong reactions, shock |
| "mix", "variety" | `variety` | One clip from each category |

---

## Dynamic clip count

3 clips per hour of stream, minimum 3, maximum 20:

| Stream length | Target clips |
|---|---|
| 1 hour | 3 |
| 2 hours | 6 |
| 4 hours | 12 |
| 7+ hours | 20 (capped) |

## Key design decisions

- **Local-only inference**: all models run on user hardware; no API keys, no per-token costs
- **LM Studio for LLM inference**: runs natively on Windows; supports NVIDIA+AMD multi-GPU without WSL2 driver hacks; OpenAI-compatible API
- **One model in VRAM at a time**: explicit unloading between stages prevents OOM; pipeline calls `POST /api/v1/models/unload` at stage transitions
- **Whisper runs on GPU when available**: runs inside Docker with NVIDIA CUDA; unloads LLM model first; CPU int8 fallback
- **Vision is non-gatekeeping**: vision enrichment can only boost scores, never eliminate clips; frame content is often visually boring even when audio is clip-worthy
- **Time-bucket distribution**: prevents early-VOD bias by guaranteeing clip selection from each time bucket
- **Blur-fill rendering**: full 16:9 content visible on 9:16 canvas — no information loss from hard crop
- **Two text models**: `qwen3.5-9b-instruct` for pipeline (better moment detection), `qwen2.5-7b-instruct` for Discord (reliable tool calling with small models)
